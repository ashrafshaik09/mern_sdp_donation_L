# About the project:

This project implements an Online donation system, which is still under development, but almost all the essential features and functionalities work
successfully. So far, we have established a registration portal for users (donors), and a landing page for viewing various listed donations, among which a donor can enter the amount he/she wishes to donate and make a successful payment using Razorpay API (This API is in Test Demo, so no actual payments are done, only the demonstration is observed). 

The project has a clean User Interface (UI), with seamless frontend and backend connected, all using the MERN full stack technology.
